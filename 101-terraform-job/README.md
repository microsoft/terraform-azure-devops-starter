# Basic Terraform job

## About this template

This template includes a multi-stage pipeline that deploys 
an environment from Terraform configuration, and run
a subsequent job configured from Terraform outputs.

The Terraform definition only deploys an empty resource group.
You can extend the definition with your custom infrastructure, such as Web Apps.
